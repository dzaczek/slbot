# Comment regarding Population Size:
# We use a population of 150 because the input space is very large (145 inputs).
# Slither.io is a complex spatial environment where simple policies might get stuck easily.
# A larger population increases the diversity of initial topologies and weights,
# giving the evolutionary algorithm a better chance to escape local optima
# (like just spinning in circles or avoiding everything too conservatively).
