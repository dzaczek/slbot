Major changes needed: LR, reward structure, curriculum.

1. Average reward negative. Reduce penalties or boost food_reward.

## AI Supervisor — Recent Changes

| Time | Episode | Changes | Reasoning |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| 02-17 13:20 | 3400 | `death_snake`=-70.0, `enemy_proximity_penalty`=2.0 | The agent is dying primarily from snake collisions (51.6%) in stage 1, which should focus on food collection. The high reward trend (+6925) shows improvement, but the negative Q-values and high collision rate suggest the death penalties need strengthening to discourage risky behavior. |
| 02-17 15:00 | 3600 | `death_snake`=-45.0 | The agent shows strong improvement (reward trend +1272) but has a critical problem: 63.6% deaths from snake collisions in Stage 1, which should focus on food collection. The high sharp turn usage (40.5%) suggests erratic movement. Need to reduce snake collision penalty to allow more exploration and learning. |
| 02-17 15:33 | 3800 | `enemy_proximity_penalty`=2.0 | The agent is dying primarily from snake collisions (57.4%) in stage 1, which should focus on food collection. The high reward trend (+59.5) shows good learning progress, but the agent needs stronger penalties for risky behavior. Increasing enemy proximity penalty will discourage getting too close to other snakes. |
| 02-17 16:05 | 4000 | `death_snake`=-65.0, `enemy_proximity_penalty`=2.5 | The agent is performing well in Stage 1 with good food collection (82.39 avg) and reasonable survival. However, 52.8% snake collision deaths suggest the agent needs stronger penalties for risky behavior. The high sharp turn usage (40.6%) and low straight movement (7.6%) indicate erratic movement patterns that lead to self-collisions. |
| 02-17 16:39 | 4200 | `epsilon_target`=0.35, `death_snake`=-45.0 | The agent is showing good food collection (81.77 avg) but concerning signs: reward trend is negative (-16.16), nearly 50% snake collision deaths, and very low exploration (epsilon 0.08). The high sharp turn usage (39.7%) suggests erratic movement patterns that lead to self-collisions. |
| 02-17 17:14 | 4400 | `death_snake`=-60.0, `epsilon_target`=0.3 | The agent is showing good learning progress with improving rewards and steps, but has concerning death patterns - 45.8% snake deaths in stage 1 suggests the agent is being too aggressive with sharp turns (39.6%) and needs better survival incentives. The high action entropy (0.899) indicates good exploration but may need slightly more focus. |
| 02-17 18:54 | 4600 | `death_snake`=-75.0, `enemy_proximity_penalty`=2.0 | The agent is performing well in Stage 1 with strong reward trend (+152) and good food collection (89.75 avg). However, 55.6% snake collision deaths suggest the agent is being too aggressive or not learning proper avoidance. The high sharp turn usage (38.8%) indicates erratic movement patterns that may contribute to self-collisions. |
| 02-17 19:42 | 4800 | `death_snake`=-85.0, `enemy_proximity_penalty`=1.5 | The agent is dying to snake collisions 67.8% of the time in Stage 1, which should focus on food collection. The high snake death rate and preference for sharp turns (39.3%) suggests the agent is being too aggressive. Need to increase snake death penalty and reduce enemy penalties to encourage safer food-seeking behavior. |
| 02-17 20:25 | 5000 | `death_snake`=-95.0 | The agent is dying 80.8% from snake collisions in stage 1, which should focus on food collection. The high sharp turn usage (40.6%) and declining reward trend suggest the agent is struggling with basic navigation. The death penalty for snake collision needs to be more severe to discourage this behavior. |
| 02-17 21:15 | 5200 | `death_snake`=-100, `epsilon_target`=0.35 | The agent has a severe snake collision problem (81.2% death rate) while in Stage 1, which should focus on food collection. The high death rate from self-collision suggests the agent needs stronger penalties for risky maneuvers and potentially higher exploration to learn safer paths. |
| 02-17 22:01 | 5400 | `enemy_proximity_penalty`=2.2, `enemy_approach_penalty`=1.5 | The agent is dying from snake collisions 80.2% of the time in Stage 2 (Wall Avoid), which suggests insufficient penalty for enemy proximity. The high sharp turn usage (38.9%) indicates reactive rather than proactive avoidance. Increasing enemy proximity penalties should encourage better positioning. |
| 02-17 22:48 | 5600 | `enemy_proximity_penalty`=2.8, `enemy_approach_penalty`=1.8, `lr`=0.00015 | Snake collisions dominate deaths at 74.8%, indicating the agent struggles with enemy avoidance in Stage 2. The high reward trend (+174) shows learning progress, but enemy proximity penalties need strengthening. Also, the low learning rate may be limiting adaptation speed given the stable loss trend. |
| 02-17 23:42 | 5800 | `enemy_proximity_penalty`=3.0, `enemy_approach_penalty`=2.0, `death_snake`=-40.0 | Snake collision deaths at 77% indicate severe enemy avoidance issues in stage 3. The agent is being too aggressive with sharp turns (37.7%) and U-turns (19.2%) but still dying to enemies. Need to increase enemy penalties and reduce death penalties to encourage more cautious behavior. |
